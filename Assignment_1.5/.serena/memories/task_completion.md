## Task Completion Checklist

When completing a task in this project, ensure the following:

1. **Code Implementation**
   - Implementation matches the mathematical descriptions in README
   - All required methods are implemented (especially in PID and iLQR classes)
   - Code follows the established style guidelines

2. **Testing**
   - Run the controller in both normal and fast mode
   - Compare scores with baseline results from README
   - Test with different parameters (e.g., different masses for MPC)

3. **Performance Verification**
   - Check if your controller can collect balloons effectively
   - Compare performance with other controllers
   - Document any high scores that exceed the baseline

4. **Documentation**
   - Add comments explaining key mathematical operations
   - Document any parameter tuning or improvements
   - Note any significant deviations from the baseline approach

5. **Submission Requirements**
   - Code is complete and runs without errors
   - High scores are documented if they exceed baseline
   - Any improvements or modifications are clearly documented
